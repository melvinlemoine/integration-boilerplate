# Integration Starter Template
Repository created for students who want to set up projects quickly.

‚û° In this repository, all is ready, just ``$ npm install`` to install packages & watch SASS with ``$ npm run watch``.

# Commands
*Before use de commands, don't forget to install the dependencies with `$ npm install`.*

- `$ npm run watch` : compile the SASS on save.
- `$ npm run deploy` : compile the SASS to CSS properly *(more about this below)*.
- `$ npm run build-images` : compress all images in `src/images` and put the render in `/dist/images`.
- `$ npm run assets` : copy all assets in `src/` to `/dist/` (css & fonts).

# CSS render
To compile the SASS to CSS properly *(the ``$ npm run watch`` command only compile but do not autoprefix and clean)*, execute ``$ npm run deploy``.
This will compile the SASS with :
- Autoprefixer : add automaticly prefixs to maximize compatibility with all browsers
- Clean CSS : Removed comments and minify the stylesheet

# Images
Put your images in `src/images`. To compress them execute `$ npm run compress-images`.
